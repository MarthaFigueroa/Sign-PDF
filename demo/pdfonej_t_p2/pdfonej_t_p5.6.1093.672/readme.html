    <h3><a href="#order"></a><a name="introduction"></a>Introduction</h3>
    <p>Gnostice PDFOne is a PDF document creation, transformation and
      management library for Java developers. PDFOne can create and
      manage PDF documents from within application programs and web
      services. PDFOne supports creating, filling and reading of PDF
      forms, compressing, securing, appending and merging of multiple
      PDF documents, stamping, managing bookmarks, creating tables,
      creating and reading PDF annotations and much more. PDFOne
      operates on existing PDF documents and can even create new ones
      from scratch. For detailed features please visit

    <p><b>NOTE</b>: At present user system properties (e.g. CLASSPATH)
      are not updated automatically. Hence to start using PDFOne.jar
      follow one of these instructions based on the project need.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>For console based projects, to compile, set CLASSPATH manually
        to the location where PDFOne.jar is located.</li>
      <li>For IDE based projects, to compile, add a reference to
        PDFOne.jar in your project. This is an IDE dependent action.
        Please refer to IDE manual/help to know how to add external JAR.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3><a name="known_issues"></a>Known Issues / Limitations / Changes</h3>

      <li>Annotations and Formfields may not appear on rotated pages.</li>
      <li>Opening and Printing document after saving (with
        setOpenAfterSave and setPrintAfterSave method call) may not work
        as expected on some Operating Systems.</li>
      <li>Call to extractPagesTo, appendPagesFrom and insertPagesFrom
        methods, removes all page level actions, link annotation actions
        and form fields actions.</li>
      <li>Addition of new actions, when reading a document, removes all
        existing page level actions.</li>
      <li>Named tree merging is not implemented.</li>
      <li>Addition of same instance of annotation list to multiple pages
        having inconsistent measurement units shows unexpected behavior.</li>
      <li>Viewer and printer do not support the following features:
        <ul>
          <li>Fonts
            <ul>
              <li>Exact substitution of 14 types of Adobe Standard Type
                1 fonts</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Color spaces
            <ul>
              <li>DeviceN (with Type 3 and Type 4 functions; and non-RGB
                and non-CMYK colors)</li>
              <li>Separation (with Type 3 and Type 4 functions; and
                non-RGB and non-CMYK colors)</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Image-decoding algorithms
            <ul>
              <li>Any supported image format but only in rare
                circumstances</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>All graphics patterns except tiling</li>
          <li>Annotations
            <ul>
              <li>All types of annotations except link annotations</li>
              <li>Highlighting modes for links annotations</li>
              <li>All types of PDF actions of link annotations other
                than go-to, named, and URI</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Using page margins less than those specified in the
            physical printer.</li>
          <li>Printing with a custom page size not supported by the
            physical printer - prints to a nearest standard dimension
            supported by the physical printer.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Viewer performance may become slow if a large number of pages
        are set to be viewed in a single screen.</li>
      <li>If you load a digitally signed document and make changes to
        it, the existing signature(s) will become invalid. This is
        because support for incrementally updating a document is not yet
        available. You may, if you wish, call the
        PdfDocument.removeAllSignature() method (which removes all
        existing signatures) and then sign the document to keep the
        modified document free of any invalidated signatures.</li>
      <!--
 <li>PDFOne uses Bouncy Castle Crypto package, a Java implementation of
 cryptographic algorithms, to decrypt PDF document encrypted using AES algorithm.
 The jar file should be available in the classpath of the application. Currently
 PDFOne supports only decryption, not encryption, using AES algorithm.
 Hence, if an AES-encrypted document is loaded and modified, then final document
 will be encrypted using RC4. The document will retain only the owner or user
 password that was provided for loading the document. The other password will 
 be set as blank.</li>

        methods as source is not included. Follow this link for more
